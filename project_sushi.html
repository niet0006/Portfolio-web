                stablishing the problem. Then, the research and collection of quantitative and qualitative data was carried out through 
                interviews. All the information gathered was used analyze it and obtain the insights. We proceeded to start with the design 
                phase, and  low and high fidelity prototypes were made. Finally, usability tests were carried out to observe aspects to be 
                improved and the user's interaction with the product.

                        digitally. 
                         The website doesn't provide any important information for making an 
                        order or reserving a table, and the information provided is 
                        disorganized, lacks hierarchy, and confuses the users. 
                         The primary problem that the website addressed was the menu 
                        because was difficult to navigate and didn't provide complementary 
                        description for the food.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
            This project was a huge learning experience for me in so many ways.  I learned a lot about the design process, and how to identify and solve customer needs. Moreover, I would like to highlight some aspects that impact caught my attention:
            
            1. Business needs and User needs 
            My work as a designer is based on solving problems that improve the experience of a product or service. I was able to see that our job is not only to delight the user, but we also need to provide a solution that adds value to the business.
            
            2. The importance of research
            Compared to previous projects, this project required more profound research. This was the perfect opportunity to strengthen my research skills and get more involved in learning about users and their needs. I realized that research provides an essential foundation for design strategy since you will have the data to back your strategy and design decision
